<p>I was super honoured to be asked to write for <a href="http://24ways.org/" rel="external">24 Ways</a> this year.</p>
<p>I thought I'd write a little something reflecting my 'Make Your Browser Dance' talk, which was about triggering CSS animations with data from audio, all through the use of the Web Audio API.</p>
<p>You can check it out <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/make-your-browser-dance/" rel="external">the article here</a> and also the <a href="http://dancing.rumyra.com/" rel="external">sweet visual demo here</a>.</p>
