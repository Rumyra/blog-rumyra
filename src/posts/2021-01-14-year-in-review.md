One thing which was on my goal list for 2020 was to write more. I mean there is no post here from 2019, so it wasn't difficult to have a higher velocity than that. And I posted twice last year so thumbs-ups me üëç

I've been thinking about dedicating some time to writing each week, we'll see how it goes. Most of the time I have loads of things I _want_ to write about, but don't feel confident about sharing, what is, by and large, my opinion. I think I should address this.

As it's customary on personal blog sites to write a year in review, I wrote an absurdly long post about last year. It would seem a lot happened even though it actually didn't ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Rather than subject you, dear reader, to ramblings, here are some bullet points:

- Prominent year in modern history
- Started like any other, helped out on a project; [Stupid Cities](https://alpha.stupidcities.com/) created by [Joseph Wilk](https://twitter.com/josephwilk)
- Started showing covid symptoms on 22nd March, one week before the UK entered it's first lockdown
- Got very sick for a very long time (still have long covid symptoms almost a year later)
- June onwards started a contract with Google DevRel team, to help them with the backlog of MDN docs that needed writing for new Web APIs: This was wonderful and I will do a proper run down in a separate post
- Pushed myself hard over the summer health wise. Big shout out to the ladies; Michelle, Tash and Amanda. Who not only supported me when I was super ill (thanks for the deliveries üíú), but also knew how important it was to be there socially too.
- Mozilla got in contact seeing if I could come on board and help with MDN tasks: Obviously a big yes, I love writing for MDN and long may it continue!
- Ran two 20hr week contracts from October until Christmas, which honestly was a _lot_ considering my health, but also amazing so...
- [Live JS](https://livejs.network/) is very much alive and well. They all made some great things in lockdown and it's one of my fav monthly catch ups. I took a big ol' backseat and want to say thank you to all of them for being so understanding.
- [Tim H](https://tholman.com/) was incredibly supportive considering recording podcast episodes became difficult with my health. He [released a couple](https://generativeartistry.com/episodes/) we thankfully had in the drawer and was super patient and now we're recording regularly again üôå
- My sister had a baby girl and although I couldn't go and see them and it was difficult, they are both beautiful and healthy and send me pictures every 5 minutes üòÜ
