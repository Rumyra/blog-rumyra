### Demos & Sites

Probably my personal highlight for the week: The [MediaRecorder API](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediastream-recording/) is now available in Chrome 49 stable and Firefox 25+. More on this later Iâ€™m sure, but [Soledad](https://soledadpenades.com/), covers [it all here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/record-almost-everything-in-the-browser-with-mediarecorder/) in her special super way.

One of my [good internet friends (@nexii)](https://twitter.com/nexii) showed [me this](http://thejameskyle.com/spectacle-code-slide/) - if youâ€™re doing code in your presentations you may want to take a look.

If you want to learn angular, (or level up), I recommend [Todd Motto](https://courses.toddmotto.com/), he has some great online courses and he lives next door (ok five minutes down the road, but weâ€™re countryside so I stand by *neighbour*).

Paul Kinlan put together a [site to showcase Web Apps](http://mobilewebappsftw.tumblr.com/) - cos we all know they are the coolest kind of apps (/me ducks). You can [submit yours here](http://mobilewebappsftw.tumblr.com/submit).


### Articles

Andy Budd wrote a [great article about design thinking](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2016/04/what_the_hell_is_design_thinking_anyway/), with great references to other types of thinking, just to make you way less confused.

Jeremy [always talks sense](https://adactio.com/journal/10467) although I have always felt [like thereâ€™s poniesâ€¦ everywhere](http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/there-is-a-horse-in-the-apple-store/)!

Weâ€™re reminded that sometimes you should [question the standards you think you know](https://silktide.com/i-thought-title-text-improved-accessibility-i-was-wrong/) Via [@edent and @laurakalbag](https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/716971377719447553)

Still not excited about streams? No fear, Jakeâ€™s still got your back on this one. [Here he mixes up streams and template literals](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/streaming-template-literals/) and the results are all rather gravy (streamy - the results are streamy).

### Conferences

Microsoft stormed it at the beginning of the week (probably because of Christianâ€™s wonderful comparing and added jokes) with their [Edge Web Summit](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/tag/web-summit/). I live streamed the beginning, yet still to [catch up on the rest](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/edgesummit2016), but as a summary, the Edge team are doing amazing things. Internet high fives all round _o/\o_

(Shout out to Paul Lewis for introducing me to internet high fives)

#### This week Iâ€™m going to stay home grown: Look out for

- [Render](http://2016.render-conf.com/) later this month in Oxford. Iâ€™m going to by pass the incredible speaker line up and go straight in for Oxford is cool and so is the community there, most of them are going so youâ€™ll be in great company!
- [Port 80 is back in Newport](http://port80events.co.uk/event/port-80-2016/) on May 20th with a great line up
- [UpFrontConf](http://upfrontconf.com) is also back at the end of May in Manchester. Theyâ€™re running a [lovely bursary programme for under represented genders](http://upfrontconf.com/speaker-bursary/) - if you want to speak, want to start out, want some help/mentoring etcâ€¦ totally check it out. Not only is this an incentive close to my heart, but the peeps who organise are wonderful too.
- [Hackference, Birmingham](https://www.papercall.io/hackference-2016) and [WDC2016, Bristol](http://alexolder.com/speak-at-wdc2016/) also both have their CFPâ€™s open for the autumn season


### One sad thing

I received my generic â€˜Your App has been Disabledâ€™ from the Firefox OS Marketplace Team ðŸ˜¢

### One amazing thing
