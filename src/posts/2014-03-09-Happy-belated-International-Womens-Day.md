<p>Yesterday was <a href="http://www.internationalwomensday.com/">International Women's Day, a celebration of being of the fairer sex all over the globe.</a></p>
<p>I work in the web/app development industry. It is male dominated. I have seen lot of sexism in my career, but then I have in my everyday life as well. Just yesterday my middle aged next door neighbour Nigel was explaining I couldn't possibly know what size screws were. Why Nigel? It it my bleach blonde hair? My fair skin which makes me look in my twenties (thanks mum &amp; dad). Or is it my breasts.</p>
<p>It was the latter wasn't it, let's be honest.</p>
<p>I regularly, as many women, <a href="http://everydaysexism.com/">face everyday sexism</a>, just like this.</p>
<p>But this weekend, I want to take a different approach.</p>
<p>I want to be thankful.</p>

<p>I want to be grateful that I don't have to cover my face, by law, if I don't want to, and that I can if I feel like it. I wish I could hug all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragette">suffragettes</a> at the turn of the last century, who starved themselves just so I could vote today.</p>
<p>I want to be thankful I had the opportunity to have a university level education. That I can drive a car, have a job and rent a flat. That I can live on my own.</p>
<p>All these things I find myself reminding myself of when I do find out I earn less than my male counterparts <sup>1</sup>, when someone's eyes widen when they find out I'm 32, unmarried and without children.</p>
<p>And yes, when Nigel assumes I wouldn't know anything about screws.</p>
<p>And men - I implore you to be grateful too. That you live in the company of such a vibrant, individualist society, with beautiful women in your life, who actually chose to be there.</p>
<p>Most of all, I hope I can look back on this post in years to come and that all these issues, someday, will not be issues at all.</p>
