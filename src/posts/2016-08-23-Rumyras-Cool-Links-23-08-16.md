I wrote this two days ago when I was stuck in an airport. I'm sure each one of you has frequented an airport recently what with it being the summer holidays and all. In fact you might even be reading this in an airport. It's not a long one, I've been a bit out of touch with the travelling, but there's still some gems 💎

[Adam's](https://twitter.com/onishiweb) been doing some great writing recently, check out [his blog](http://adamonishi.com/) if you don't already. [This article about Web Components and progressive enhancements](http://adamonishi.com/2016/08/web-components-and-progressive-enhancement/) is especially cool.

Something also super helpful for me recently was [this blog post from Daniel Mies](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2016/07/getting-started-webpack/) about getting started with webpack. I was postCSS/cssnext-ing and not only was [Daniel](https://twitter.com/danielmies) extremely helpful (super cool person to follow), but so was his post.

[Generate your own map](http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/) using a really well thought out process and well documented. In face check out [Martin's homepage](http://mewo2.com/) it appears everything he does is a pretty cool link.

Not audio enough for you yet? I've been checking out and playing around with [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) recently. It's a super nice layer over the Web Audio API. Me and [Sam](https://twitter.com/_2xAA) put together a cool thing which I will share after I've stopped demoing it at conferences. (I promise it's super cool).

Not cool enough for you yet?  Check out [this insane emoji fest](http://executabledreams.net/B/emojiwin) - solitare style graphics on canvas - also supports multi touch events! Yup, I think it's actually too cool. 🎶💥🎉😎💙

Oh and it's my birthday in a month. Yes, I know you're thinking: 'What the 😳 can I get Ruth? She's already got like 5 MIDI controllers...' Well you can totally [donate to the Holtzmanns glasses fund](https://www.paypal.me/rumyra). Yes I super think having a [pair of these](http://www.liveforfilm.com/2016/08/04/ghostbusters-you-can-buy-holtzmanns-glasses/) from the recent Ghostbusters would be super cool to VJ in 😎->😆 Hell I'd even wear them when writing these cool links posts, and that would easily make them ten times cooler!
