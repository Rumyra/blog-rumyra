So back just before Christmas, I was doing a little research [for an article](https://24ways.org/2015/bringing-your-code-to-the-streets), and [I tweeted](https://twitter.com/Rumyra/status/670587879882625024):

>Looking for examples of JavaScript being used in extraordinary situations (e.g. art installations) - send me links :) (RTs super welcome ðŸ˜Š)

The response was phenomenal - thank you to everyone who (...eyes up douche term...) *engaged*. Because there was such an incredible response I thought I should put a list of links right here.
