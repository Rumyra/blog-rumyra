Last Tuesday I was privilege to speak at the <a href="http://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/learning-and-skills-group/" rel="external">Learning & Skills Group Conference</a> at <a href="http://www.olympia.co.uk/" rel="external">Kensington Olympia</a> along with the amazing <a href="http://shkspr.mobi/blog/">Terence Eden</a>.

We were talking about mobile behaviour and usability. Terence took most of the talk, and I added some Mobile UX at the end. There was a great question and answer session as well.

What was interesting was talking to people who aren't necessarily your peers in the industry. If I talk at any web conferences/meet ups that's essentially what I'm doing. It was great just to see how others have started thinking about responsive design, desktop vs mobile, web vs native experiences etc... It's beginning to become mainstream :)
