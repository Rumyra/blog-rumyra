<p>I woke up this morning, bleary eyed, slightly hungover from the first (amaze) day at <a href="http://2013.cssdevconf.com/"  rel="external">CSS Dev Conference</a> and really really felt compelled to write this.</p>

<p>I'm a little scared of publishing it. I don't want to be preachy - you do some code, you do it your way, it works, you're happy, I'm happy, everyone's happy. Awesome.</p>

<p>But I just wanted to say: <strong>CSS devs, try preprocessors.</strong></p>

<p>Please.</p>

<p>Just try them, just once.</p>

<p>Just spend half an hour reading about the added functionality of using a CSS preprocessor.</p>

<p>(Did I jump in too fast - if you're unsure of what a CSS preprocessor is <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/css/css-preprocessors/" rel="external">there's a nice intro here</a>).</p>

<p>Recently I've spoken to a few FEDs who frown and shun when I mention SASS (My preprocessor of choice <a href="http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/8-css-preprocessors-to-speed-up-development-time" rel="external">there are plenty available</a>). One of the main reasons is "I can't find the bit of code when I inspect the element in a browser and it gives me a line number, but that's not where the css is cos it's compiled and blah blah…" (At this point I kinda fade out and start thinking about how this isn't an issue so much anymore and maybe they're structuring their files wrong… but that's a whole different post).</p>

<p>I write all of this just as <a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier" rel="external">Chris Coyier</a>, who I am listening too right now, says </p>

<blockquote>You're decision might be 'Should I use SASS' well the answer to that one is yes but…</blockquote>

<p>OK, yeh I totally took that out of context, sorry, but <strong>please</strong>, just try it. You may hate it and go back to vanilla CSS, but you'll have a much better idea, within like one hour, of what is on the horizon for the CSS spec. That's gotta be worth it right?</p>

<p>Right.</p>
