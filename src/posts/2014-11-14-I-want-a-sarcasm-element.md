<sarcasm>
<code>&lt;sarcasm></code><i>Throws toys out the pram</i><code>&lt;/sarcasm></code>

<p>For aaaggees now I've wanted a way to express my sarcasm over the internets. When you're typing this can be pretty hard... it can get lost pretty quickly when words on a screen don't come with tone.</p>

<p>Enter the <code>&lt;sarcasm></code> element*. I, (as well as others), have been know to add this to IRC chats, or at least end a line with <code>&lt;/sarcasm></code>.</p>

<p>It suddenly changes the tone of the conversation. You become enlightened as to body language that otherwise gets missed when not in direct vicinity with another person.</p>

<p>And why stop at sarcasm, could we express other emotions too - just with one element and it's attributes?</p>

<code>&lt;emotion type="excited">I'm going to the fair tomorrow!&lt;/emotion></code>

<p>Are there too many emotions, (and variations of such), or maybe I'm just about to step into a debate about how emotions don't matter and only logic prevails.</p>

<code>&lt;emotion type="scared">I'd better get out of here!&lt;/emotion></code>

<p>*This idea is in no way practical.</p>
</sarcasm>

<p>EDIT 9.1.15: There is a sarcasm punctuation mark, as I discovered whilst watching <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006t6l0" rel="external">University Challenge</a> the other day. There's more about it on <a href="http://www.sarcmark.com/" rel="external">the sarc mark website</a>.</p>
