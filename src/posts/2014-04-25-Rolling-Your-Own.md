<p>I don't like to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning.</p>
<p>I like to spend a lot of time in the shower, cos showers are nice, but the whole idea of styling hair and painting on eye makeup has always made me feel like I could be spending my time better... Like an extra half hour in bed for instance.</p>
<p>So, as a time saver, I make my own face cream, I always have. It's a mix of my preferred moisturiser, foundation and skin cream. This means I only have to slap this on once and I'm done.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago cosmetic companies started to produce a thing they dubbed BB cream. For those unaware its a similar idea, foundation, moisturiser, skin cream, serums, oils etc... All rolled into one.</p>
<p>I still make my own.</p>
<p>I've checked out a number of these BB creams and I don't feel like any of them are suitable for my needs. Although the concept is the same, I like my own recipe.</p>
<p>Sometimes its cool &amp; ok to roll your own for your own specific needs... Even if there are things out there that are similar.</p>
