<p>At the start of this month, I was very privileged to be asked to speak at <a href="http://2013.canvasconf.co.uk/" title="http://2013.canvasconf.co.uk/">Canvas Conf</a>, I was absolutely honoured. Not only was it an amazingly well organised conference in a surprisingly lovely location, but also because of the magnitude of speakers that I got to speak with and meet!</p>

<p>The conference bought together creatives, developers and marketeers and was hosted by <a href="http://383project.com/" title="http://383project.com/">383</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/tpryan" title="https://twitter.com/tpryan">Terry Ryan</a> from Adobe opened with some new exciting stuff Adobe are doing with CSS - specifically <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/animate/" title="http://html.adobe.com/edge/animate/">Edge</a> and CSS animation. <a href="https://twitter.com/mattpointblank" title="https://twitter.com/mattpointblank">Matt Andrews</a> from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk" title="http://www.theguardian.com/uk">The Guardian</a> chatted about responsive design and how to tackle it. I was up next with my most common talk of this year - an <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rumyra/building-apps-for-firefoxos" title="https://speakerdeck.com/rumyra/building-apps-for-firefoxos">Introduction to Firefox OS</a> and how to start building apps for it. My only concern was I was so practised at the talk I forgot to slow down and so ended earlier than I should have :S Also that I had to follow Matt and precede <a href="https://twitter.com/ErisDS" title="https://twitter.com/ErisDS">Hannah Wolfe</a>, who had some really interesting insights into building the publishing platform <a href="https://ghost.org/features" title="https://ghost.org/features">Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>All in all I was completely taken with Birmingham. Everyone I met was absolutely lovely and the city (although I kept to the centre) was enchanting. On a personal note I couldn't thank 383 more for asking me to talk, it was such a privilege!</p>
