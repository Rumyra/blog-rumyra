So I fell over in the shower this morning.

I say in the shower, I ended up outside of it.

It was all very odd, one foot slipped and as I tried to steady myself with the other that went from underneath me as well. I clung on for dear life to the shower head, which I perceive helped me with my landing. With all the tumbles I have taken in the past few years, I came out of this one pretty unscathed, however it got me thinking:

What's the problem here? Is it <i>a)</i> The bath tub is slippy, <i>b)</i> My balance is off, either through problems with my ears, or I'm just not as young and spritely as I was, or <i>c)</i> I just randomly fell over.

Now, I have been known to be partial to a bit of rough, but falling out of the shower is not something I would want to do on a regular basis, so how can I prevent myself doing it again?

Well I can either <i>a)</i> Get one of those non slip bath mat thingys, <i>b)</i> Go and get my ears checked or <i>c)</i> Nothing at all.

An important lesson if you are trying to build something that is useful & helps people. Always decide what the problem is, and don't loose sight of this problem throughout building the solution.</p>

UPDATE: I haven't fallen over in the shower since this, however a guest did the other day. We bought a non-slip mat.
