So you may have caught wind of some phones that were released this week - namely the geeksphone. But what the hell is it all about?

Some time last year Mozilla - the web company probably best known for its browser Firefox - started developing software that could run on devices such as mobile phones. (Smart phones?) This is firefoxOS. Think iOS or Android - you will see a very similar thing when you see a phone running firefoxOS - a nice flick through interface with icons representing the apps installed.

The geeksphones youve been hearing about are an initial release of phones running firefoxos aimed at developers so they can start developing and testing apps on them - we can look ar them as an indicator?

So why bother i hear you ask - we've already got iphones, a million androids - some of which are quite affordable and ubuntu released a mobile operating system themselves (more here?)

Well firstly theres the affordability - the cheaper geeksphone that just got released is $ -this indicates its not a competitor to the new iphone or android which you're looking at around $ for. Mozilla are planning to launch firefoxOS phones on a more public basis (contracts) etc... In south america. Not really the rich american or european market we may assume they are targeting. One where a smart phone for under $100 becomes a sort after thing.

Secondily and im going tog et a little techie - apologies - developers can use open web technologies to develop apps. To develop apps for iphone you use one programming language, for android another - for web yet more. But all the web ones work on a firefoxOS phone - theres nothing new to learn for a web application developer like me and many others.

With a firefox os phone it's not about web vs native - its both! I think thats pretty genius and personally extremely exciting.

Open web - what it lets you do not how you do it.
