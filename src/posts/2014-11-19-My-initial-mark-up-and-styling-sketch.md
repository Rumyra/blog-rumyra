My first HTML, CSS & JavaScript version of a website or app is rarely my final one. Most of the time I do an initial 'pencil sketch'. I concentrate more on the content and semantics and then roughly lay it all out and style it with CSS, with only minimal JavaScript functionality.

I try not to spend too much time on the detail, as from experience i find details are always being changed and refined. So I usually take this pencil sketch back for a review with clients/colleagues.

There is obviously initial explaining to do, to make sure who I'm reviewing the piece of work with understands it's only about 40% complete. But once accepted I think this method has benefits.

You can start to see the build on devices. Before now it's most likely been a sketch, wireframe or flat design. Seeing it in situ I believe, means the more detailed discussions are easier to envisage.
You can start looking at the functionality, what happens when the user clicks, swipes, hovers or taps.
You can put it in front of a user and start early testing.
If you're working with a designer, they can see where parts of their design may not work in quite the same way as in a flat file and start making their adjustments.

Over all changes can easily be made, without me feeling like I've spent an age getting everything pixel perfect and evidently it was a waste of time. Making assumptions about small parts of interactivity.
