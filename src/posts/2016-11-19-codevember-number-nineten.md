Phew, there was a break wasn't there! Apparently it's hard to keep up when you're on the road. So I thought there's probably only one thing to do and that's try and do *two* codevembers for the next few days to make up for it.

Let's see how that goes ðŸ¤“

### AudioVis #9

NB This one comes with a warning. The way I coded this is highly UNRECOMMENDED. Not only was it a total ball ache, it doesnâ€™t perform well and there are work arounds. It took what felt like days and the result is not amazing. If youâ€™re wondering, I would probably use canvas for an audio vis of this nature in future. Hashtag learning, amiright?

So today Iâ€™m going to expand a little on yesterday and take influence from [this crazy gif](http://intothecontinuum.tumblr.com/post/119241330868/maihudson-mathematica-codesn-t-sinn3)

But in my version, I want a shape for each of the low frequencies, the mid frequencies and the high frequencies, that change depending on the level we get back from the analysis.

I'm setting a load more custom properties than the previous [codevember](https://codepen.io/Rumyra/pen/yVeoJo), so I'm looping over them in the JS. Things I learnt include:

- We actually donâ€™t need to set those properties in the root block at the top of our CSS if weâ€™re setting them within our JavaScript. Theyâ€™re set there, so they get passed into the CSS regardless... nuice!
- Maths in CSS is hard, even with nice things like a `calc` function and shiny extras preprocessors like Sass give us. JavaScript is much better as maths, so I found keeping number crunching there is a lot better. Just pass the value you want in the CSS into the custom property.

This one was a great learning experience and great experiment, even if the final result wasn't ideally what I was after at the start. I would keep using custom properties to do things like filter effects and glitch's for final VJing rather than modifying multiple DOM elements with them in the future.

### AudioVis #10: Blend Modes ðŸ˜Ž

I've actually written about using blend modes for [this audio vis before](http://rumyrashead.com/a-little-thing-about-blends.html). The make up of the visual itself isn't too different code wise to previous ones. I have some DOM elements, I am positioing them, I am animating them, the only extra feature I am encorporating is blend modes on the elements to see what effect that has.

It looks super nice, but with all the DOM elements I have with this one performance isn't so great. I can up it by making sure I add the `will-change` property in the CSS to any elements that have any other properties that are to change.

However I think we should probably move into a better, more performant way of creating and manipulating DOM els for audio vis, don't you?
