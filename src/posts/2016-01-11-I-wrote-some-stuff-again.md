I was a busy writing beaver the past month! I wrote an [article for the wonderful 24ways](https://24ways.org/2015/bringing-your-code-to-the-streets) about taking your code out of the browser and onto the streets. It was a nod towards thinking outside the box with web shinanigans as it isn't just about websites anymore.

I made a Portable Vj Pack (PVP) and took it around the streets of Bristol. It was great fun!

I also wrote for [the amazing 12Devs of Xmas](http://12devsofxmas.co.uk/2016/01/day-10-lets-talk-about-midi/) I'm so glad it's back after a year hiatus ðŸ˜Š

I answered angony aunt style questions about MIDI, a subject I'm extremely passionate about at the moment and you'll probably see some more musings on around here. Go check it out - MIDI is waaayy more than you think!
