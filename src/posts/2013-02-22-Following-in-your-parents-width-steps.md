Ever noticed how you assume <code>width:auto</code> will make your block level element not fill the entire width of it's container, but happily just clip to the end of it's own content, and then when you add that css attribute it doesn't make the blindest bit of difference? Which leaves you inevitably scratching your head... yup I think we've all been there.

My newest solution which I wanted to share is <code>display:inline-block</code>
