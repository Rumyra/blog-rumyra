Let's talk money shall we. I mean I never really have, but it _is_ something I think about most days.

Yes I know I know, what does a white, middle-class, tech-working woman have to say about _money_ really?

Only that I don't earn what you earn and I am really very ok with that but please don't make assumptions.

## I used to have a job

In fact I've had quite a few, ever since about 24 in the very early noughties. My first job was a php developer earning 16k a year. That was a crappy job. Next came a London agency job earning 24k (just so you know, 24k didn't give you enough a month to live in London in the early noughties, I've no idea how others did it). But then I realised it was girl money. A junior came into that office who I started tutoring on the job, it was only later did I find out he was on 35k, a full 11k more than me.

Of course, agencies employ females because they are cheap - of course. I had asked for more when I joined, but they talked me down and I had rent to pay. I needed single money.

## There are no split bills

You don't pay half rent or mortgage if there is one of you (although I have had a old striaght white male collegue tell me you do - I don't think he was bright enough to do 'finances', I mean he used to copy all my code so...). You don't pay half council tax. It doesn't take half as much electricity to cook or to heat a place.

## If you are stuggling to understand

Split up with your girlfriend, pay your self 2/3 of your income, rent a place and go to a supermarket for your one person meal.

Hahaha - supermarkets don't do one person meals! (Apart from Waitrose because they cater for old people and actually because of that they are still chepaer than Tesco because you don't end up wasting food).

Also you just lost your expendable income, that's the extra third - no more xBox360 games for you!

## Now you're getting it

So now we're in a slightly similar world, let's talk about how much I do earn.

One time I earnt enough to _have_ an expendable income. It was the most toxic job ever and I was _still_ earning 70% of my male counterparts, because they 'Didn't have enough open roles in the higher pay grade'. So I moved back in with my parents (god bless the priviledge of having parents) when I was 30, I didn't go out, go on holiday, buy things for 4 years and I saved. I saved enough to pay off the debt I had accumulated for being underpaid in the big city (~20k by that point) and enough again to put a deposit down on a micro house.

Fuck go into an estate agent as a single woman trying to buy a house - that was a riot.

I was 35 years old when I bought my 'house', it's an old showroom for a new build block of flats, so basically a 1 bed flat over two floors. I _love_ it, it's mine and I am very priviledge to work in tech, to have parents, to be white and get a mortgage. Even the year of councilling because I was morbidly suicidal after leaving that job was (I think) worth my place. _My place_.

But I work to keep my house. The mothly mortgage and bills comes to ~1100 - that's before food, mobile, clothes. I take home ~1300 a month, depending on work. My sister once said to me £50 a week is a lot and yes it is, I am not complaining. I get to buy food, sometimes some clothes. I even budget for a dentist! But god damn I budget, every few months I pour over the budget sheet, making sure I can afford the hike in any insurance, council tax, water, energy costs.

## So get a job in tech

I'd rather spend my life budgeting, because I am free. And you can't buy that.

Now imagine a world where you had £7 a week. My sister wasn't wrong (I mean she's my sister), £50 _is_ a lot. £7 is what those on benifits have. They don't get to choose a house, they move every 5 seconds. They eat a tin of canned veg and some rice once a day. But ya know we work hard so we deserve it... right  Spoiler alert, you are not special. You were born lucky, that's all.

Hey ya know, I'm alright. I learnt the hard way that I don't _like_ money. Sure it means you can pay your way out of the sludge, but you'll never be free All I'm asking is, when we're out and about, that that £50 a cocktail place means one cocktail is my entire weekly budget.

We don't like in the world, we live in our world. And tech - totally overpaid.
