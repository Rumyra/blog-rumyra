<h3>People just keep sending me links!</h3>
<p>It's so nice of them - they just tweet me cool sh*t... along with the stuff I read or see and go all like 'wo', I think this is becoming a bit of a regular thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LukyVj/family.scss">Luky VJ bought out a sass mixin library</a> to help with all those nth child thing-a-mees - that looks cool.</p>
<p>I could not agree more with <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2016/05/24/position-wanted-front-end-director/">this article by Mr. Zeldman</a> about needing a Front End Director, not only for his good points, but from a personal point of view hitting a glass ceiling a while a go and always working under either technical or creative directors, neither of whom specialise in my line of work. This would solve both frustrations in one.</p>
<p>Working with serial devices (like arduinos) and MIDI? Then <a href="http://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/">this piece of software should help</a> a nice bridge to help send and receive MIDI.</p>
<p>I attended Google I/O Extended in London last week and only really caught the keynote, so have been catching up a bit this week. There's loads of web stuff, so go take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsILe6_eGvDN3GyiodoV3qNSC">look through the listings</a>, progressive web apps are super hot. My personal pick though has to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK6Ah68jEX8&amp;index=97&amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsILe6_eGvDN3GyiodoV3qNSC">Chris Wilsons What's Next For The Web tho</a>, not only is it all the stuff I try to look at daily, but there's MIDI. It was on about midnight my time, but boy did I know about it, thanks to everyone for the tweets!</p>
<h4>Typically here's some A/V</h4>
<p>It's great to see some more people <a href="https://codepen.io/Rumyra/pen/ojoGwb">piping the audio from a mic into web visuals</a> - here's some <a href="https://the-way-we-move.surge.sh/">really gorgeous canvas ones</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/_dhar">Olivier Audard</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sil">Stuart</a> pointed out someone's recreated <a href="http://loov.io/jsfx/">SFXR in javascript...</a>. Amazing.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/matharden">Mat</a> sent me <a href="https://vimeo.com/163266757">drone ballet on Mount Fuji</a> - I think I'd either seen this or wanted to create a drone light army to music extraveganza at some point (this will happen don't worry).</p>
<p>And last but definitely not least <a href="https://twitter.com/omgmog">Max</a> sent me <a href="https://ojack.github.io/PIXELSYNTH/">Pixelsynth</a> - no words can really describe this - it is just awesome - I wish I'd thought of it.</p>
<h4>My friends have been busy doing cool things this week</h4>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben">Ben</a> has been <a href="https://historoji.herokuapp.com/">data visualising with our emojis</a> in Digital Oxford slack - this is not only a super cool link, but also totally relevant to something I'm wanting to build at the moment so I was all like 'super wo'. Can you tell the point at which we get My Little Pony emojis? Or rather I get obsessed with the My Little Pony emojis...</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/edent">Terence</a> has been <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2016/05/singing-to-my-light-bulbs/">controlling his connecting home with his very own voice!</a> Yes using his hack you can say a colour and the light will change. I should invent a drinking game which involves film titles with colours and go and play it at his house.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin">Jack</a> has put together a <a href="https://github.com/jackfranklin/express-server-boilerplate">boilerplate for a simple node/express build</a>. I've already found this pretty handy, thank you Jack.</p>
<p>And as always let's end with a personal one. Here's <em>my</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2v3mQOvOms&amp;feature=youtu.be">MIDI talk from Web Progressions</a> at Campus London a few weeks back. Stunning day conf to be a part of!</p>
