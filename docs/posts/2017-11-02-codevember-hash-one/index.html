<h3>Codevember 2017</h3>
<p>Wow I almost wrote 2018 then! It's here CODEVEMBER!! ALL THE EMOJIS</p>
<p>tl:dr;</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's Codevember</li>
  <li>Gonna do some CSS Grid</li>
  <li>Probably not every day</li>
  <li>Got a book for inspiration</li>
  <li>Will write notes</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't written much this year, it's been pretty busy... I think I'll make it more of a focus next year, there's so much I want to learn and then hopefully write about. This year has very much been about sharing my thus far found knowledge. Which I will continue to do, but there's so many things which have taken a back seat and I need to sit and learn.</p>
<p>Which is where this Codevember comes in. I need to get more practise with grid layout. I'll be teaching it in January to my bootcamp students as I'm revising my part of the course and I really want to stretch myself with it. Get it into muscle memory, and hopefully do a bit more flexbox as well. I've done a fair bit now, but I still feel like there's a lot of trial and error with both when I use them. I'm not use to this, other methods just fall off the finger tips. It'd be great to learn these inside out too.</p>
<p>I know already I can't do every day this month. I'm on a project as I write this and have 3 conferences lined up... Also I really want to buy a Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I <em>have</em> done some more visuals this year I want to share, so expect some of them mixed in too ðŸ˜„</p>
<h3>Hash 1</h3>

<p>I totally borrowed this from a work place years and years ago, then I forgot and then I left the job (:embarrassed_face:) but we had a googles today and you can get it for Â£16, so if anyone is missing it and needs reimbursing hit me up (soz).</p>
<p>I mean the title says it all really. It's got loads and loads of layouts based on different grids all the way through it. See those sticky tabs? I went through it last night and highlighted what I thought to be easy -&gt; harder layouts through the use of colour. We'll see how I get on.</p>
<h3>The exercise here is not to copy them directly...</h3>
<p>I have complete artist control, they are <em>inpiration</em>. What I want is to practise using CSS Grid, if there's part of a layout I want to change to practise something I will most likely do this.</p>
<p>So to start simple here's the first day.</p>
