<p>Phew, isn’t it warm 🌞🔥☀️*</p>
<p>Well then, I guess it’s time for another instalment of ‘Rumyra’s Cool Links’ (the time will come when this has it’s own space).</p>
<p><em>*For those viewing outside the UK it was 35 degrees yesterday and the country melted, we are currently trying to reanimate ourselves.</em></p>
<p>Easily and undoubtedly top of my cool links this time is <a href="https://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/qNrZyw">Jake Albaugh’s arpeggiator</a>. I just can <em>not</em> get enough of this. What an inspired, solid, clever and useful piece of engineering. It basically sums up everything ever about ‘why do we have the audio api again?’.</p>
<p>This. That is all. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/jake_albaugh">Mr. Albaugh</a></p>
<p>There is also <a href="http://superlooper.universlabs.co.uk/">Superlooper</a> from <a href="http://www.universlabs.co.uk/">Univers Labs</a> which not only contains beautiful loops but also visuals which are just simple but inspirational. (Very close to my own doodles around A/V so they’ll be more like this I’m sure).</p>
<p>If you want a hand with your audio visual creations <a href="https://twitter.com/likethemammal">Chris Dolphin</a> has created <a href="https://github.com/likethemammal/visualizer-micro">visualizer-micro.js</a> a teeny library wrapping just the analysis parts of the audio API, inspired by the methods from that ol’ dancer.js (man that feels like a decade ago right?).</p>
<p>Other things that are cool include <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ab73d19c160c4c509dc6b9decfec3c0f/south-korea-uses-technology-help-pregnant-women-get-seats">a great use of beacon technology to help pregnant women</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKRLcQ2Y8kA">This talk I saw at JS Oxford last month</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/ashok_menon">Ashok Menon</a> literally writing a language <em>with</em> a language, or something, it was all like 😳 Very cool tho.</p>
<p>I know others have linked to it, but the tab’s been open so long I couldn’t not include it. This is a <a href="http://a.singlediv.com/">great showcase of what you can do with just one div and a love affair with CSS</a>.</p>
<p>And if you’re still hot after all that go and buy yourself a cool print, I saw this one and thought it was cool: <a href="http://www.wearedorothy.com/shop/inside-information-minimoog">The insides of a Minimoog</a> featuring all your fav artists.</p>
