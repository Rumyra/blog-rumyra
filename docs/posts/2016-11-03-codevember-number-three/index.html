<p>This is my inspiration for today’s pen: Bridget Riley's Dilated Centres.</p>

<p>You may not be able to tell but the the circles aren’t quite concentric. The lovely <a href="http://www.lottejackson.com/learning/nth-child-cicada-principle">Lotte Jackson wrote a post</a> just over a month ago, about cicada, which reminded me about this piece. It used prime numbers and border radius’ to create a great ‘blobby’ effect on some images she was displaying on a website. It was a totally awesome technique, and I really wanted to try it out. What a great pen to do so with.</p>
<p>Not much of the code from yesterday has changed at all apart from the DOM elements and a hec of a lot more CSS. Here I’m changing the border radius when I am looping over the <code>i</code>’s in the <code>animateStuff()</code> function. We have more elements this time so it feels a bit better.</p>

I’d recommend the [opening credits to Luke Cage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gbHItHuZ0E) for this one.
