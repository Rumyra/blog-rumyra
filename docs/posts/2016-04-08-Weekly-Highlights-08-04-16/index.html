<h3>Demos &amp; Sites</h3>
<p>Probably my personal highlight for the week: The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediastream-recording/">MediaRecorder API</a> is now available in Chrome 49 stable and Firefox 25+. More on this later Iâ€™m sure, but <a href="https://soledadpenades.com/">Soledad</a>, covers <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/record-almost-everything-in-the-browser-with-mediarecorder/">it all here</a> in her special super way.</p>
<p>One of my <a href="https://twitter.com/nexii">good internet friends (@nexii)</a> showed <a href="http://thejameskyle.com/spectacle-code-slide/">me this</a> - if youâ€™re doing code in your presentations you may want to take a look.</p>
<p>If you want to learn angular, (or level up), I recommend <a href="https://courses.toddmotto.com/">Todd Motto</a>, he has some great online courses and he lives next door (ok five minutes down the road, but weâ€™re countryside so I stand by <em>neighbour</em>).</p>
<p>Paul Kinlan put together a <a href="http://mobilewebappsftw.tumblr.com/">site to showcase Web Apps</a> - cos we all know they are the coolest kind of apps (/me ducks). You can <a href="http://mobilewebappsftw.tumblr.com/submit">submit yours here</a>.</p>
<h3>Articles</h3>
<p>Andy Budd wrote a <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2016/04/what_the_hell_is_design_thinking_anyway/">great article about design thinking</a>, with great references to other types of thinking, just to make you way less confused.</p>
<p>Steve Workman wrote about implementing https at Yell: <a href="https://blog.yell.com/2016/03/https-is-hard/">Https is Hard</a></p>
<p>Jeremy <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/10467">always talks sense</a> although I have always felt <a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/there-is-a-horse-in-the-apple-store/">like thereâ€™s poniesâ€¦ everywhere</a>!</p>
<p>Weâ€™re reminded that sometimes you should <a href="https://silktide.com/i-thought-title-text-improved-accessibility-i-was-wrong/">question the standards you think you know</a> Via <a href="https://twitter.com/laurakalbag/status/716971377719447553">@edent and @laurakalbag</a></p>
<p>Still not excited about streams? No fear, Jakeâ€™s still got your back on this one. <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2016/streaming-template-literals/">Here he mixes up streams and template literals</a> and the results are all rather gravy (streamy - the results are streamy).</p>
<h3>Conferences</h3>
<p>Microsoft stormed it at the beginning of the week (probably because of Christianâ€™s wonderful comparing and added jokes) with their <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/tag/web-summit/">Edge Web Summit</a>. I live streamed the beginning, yet still to <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/edgesummit2016">catch up on the rest</a>, but as a summary, the Edge team are doing amazing things. Internet high fives all round <em>o/\o</em></p>
<p>(Shout out to Paul Lewis for introducing me to internet high fives)</p>
<h4>This week Iâ€™m going to stay home grown: Look out for</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://2016.render-conf.com/">Render</a> later this month in Oxford. Iâ€™m going to by pass the incredible speaker line up and go straight in for Oxford is cool and so is the community there, most of them are going so youâ€™ll be in great company!</li>
