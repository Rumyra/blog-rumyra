<p>I learnt a little thing whilst playing around with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode">CSS blend modes</a> this morning which I thought I should share.</p>
<p>I was just making a little visual:</p>
<figure class="media-feature">
  <img src="/media/visualPlain.jpg" />
  <figcaption>Visual without blend modes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And I thought, wouldn't it be lovely to have some CSS blend modes to add some ðŸ¤—</p>
<p>So I wrote a little Sass @each to try them out. Firstly here's the HTML of one <em>flower</em>, of which I have nine.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;section>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
  &lt;div>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/div>
&lt;/section>  
</code></pre>
<p>A bit gumphy, but rotating and sizing and well yeh... Then the @each</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">@each $num, $blendMode in 
  ( 1:overlay, 2:darken, 3:color-dodge, 4:color-burn, 5:hard-light, 6:difference, 7:hue, 8:saturation, 9:luminosity ) {
  #ohFour #screen section:nth-of-type(#{$num}) i {
    mix-blend-mode: $blendMode;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are more modes than this, but I've only got 9 sections and we can subsitute.</p>
<p>Spot the obvious mistake. By putting the blend mode onto the <code>i</code> element, we see no difference. As per the spec:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mix-blend-mode CSS property describes how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's direct parent and the element's background.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let's back up and put it on the <code>section</code>. Phew, there we go that's better.</p>

<h2>Slow rendering and FPS Monitor</h2>
<p>Now we could have put the blend mode on the <code>div</code> elements. However the performance changes dramtically.</p>
<p>What with the audio analysis, amount of DOM elements and animation <em>with</em> these blend modes is pretty trying in Chrome. I'm getting about 5fps when on the <code>div</code>. Whereas on the <code>section</code> I run at about 15fps. Not amazing, but I wonder who would notice in a club.</p>
<p>If you want to check out the FPS monitor in Chrome Dev Tools, just open them, click on the menu at the top right (three vertical dots), choose <em>'More tools'</em> -&gt; <em>'Rendering settings'</em> and check <em>'FPS Meter'</em>.</p>
<h2>Different Blend Modes</h2>
<p>Yeh I know you see it too. We've lost the little <em>flowers</em> in the centre. Some blend modes don't like being blended against black. Let's change that @each up a bit!</p>
