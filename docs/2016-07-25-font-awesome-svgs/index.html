<p>Doing a lot of prototyping in the past, having <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a> as part of my front end starter files was always really handy for quickly adding icons when I was building a UI.</p>
<p>Nowadays we are more aware that using a font to represent icons isnâ€™t necessarily the most accessible thing to do for everyone, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xXBYcWgCHA">as Serend explains here</a>.</p>

<p>So as Iâ€™m whipping up a website right at this moment I thought it a good opportunity to take the first steps to swap out the font for svgs. Soâ€¦</p>
<h5><a href="https://github.com/Rumyra/Font-Awesome-SVGs">Hereâ€™s a repo with font awesome icons as svgs</a></h5>
<ol>
<li>I forked the Font Awesome repo so I can keep it as up to date with the original as I can.</li>
<li>I added an SVG folder to add all the generated glyphs to.</li>
<li>I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-blast">font blast</a> to generate SVGs from a font, a la <a href="https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/icon-fonts-to-svg/">Sara Soueidan mentions in her blog post here</a>.</li>
<li>To include the SVGâ€™s I used the CSS Inline SVG Sprites method, <a href="https://24ways.org/2014/an-overview-of-svg-sprite-creation-techniques/">again described by Sara here</a>. It seemed the easiest to integrate with the set up I already had, as I was using classes to add icons to elements.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most long winded part was making sure I had all the correct icons - I think a good addition to this repo would be a generated spite sheet with stylesheet companion and easy reference classes. Iâ€™ve opened an issue ðŸ˜Ž</p>
